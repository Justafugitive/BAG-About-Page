This README provides step-by-step instructions on how to run the Simple React App on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Before you can run the app, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from nodejs.org.

npm (Node Package Manager): npm typically comes with Node.js installation. To check if you have npm installed, open your terminal/command prompt and run:

bash
Copy code
npm -v
If you don't have npm installed, you can download it from npmjs.com.

Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-react-app.git
Replace your-username with your GitHub username or the URL of the repository.

Change your current directory to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd simple-react-app
Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Running the App
Once you've installed the dependencies, you can start the development server and run the app:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This command will start the development server, and your default web browser should open, displaying the Simple React App. If it doesn't open automatically, you can access the app by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

Stopping the App
To stop the development server and exit the app, press Ctrl + C in the terminal where the server is running.

Congratulations!
